<h1> Why Sea Turtles Deserve A Better Life </h1>

<body>

<p> Why many americans don't think about it, sea turtles derseve a better life.
One morning when you woke up and you were tired becasue you didn't get enough sleep.
So you get ready for school and realize that you have test today,
and when you realize you have a test today you find that you need enegry.
When you need enegry, you get an enegry drink and 
when you get an enegry drink you pull it out the plastic thigny, and when you
pull it out the plastic thingy, you throw it away, and when you throw it away
you forget to break the loops, when you forget to break the loops, the plastic
loops go into the ocean, and when the plastic loops go into the ocean, they go deep
into the ocean, and when the plastic loops go deep into the ocean they find turtles,
and when they find turtles the turtles think its a snack, and when the turtles think
the plastic loops are a snack they eat them, and when they eat the plastic loops
they chocke, and when they choke they pass away. Don't make sea turtles pass away
get enough sleep!!! </p>
